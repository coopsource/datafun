* Monotone functions compose

Why is (x + log x) monotone?
Because it's a composition of monotone functions.

Simply typed lambda calculus
where all base functions are monotone
then all definable functions are monotone!

* Types enforce monotonicity!

* Modal types for nonmonotonicity

What about (log x - y)?
We know this is monotone in x and antitone in y!
But how can we typecheck that?
